# ChatApp

This is a simple JavaScript chat application I made for Advanced Techniques for Web Applications for my studies in Applied Information Technology.
Through this project, I've learned how to work with sessions, AJAX (both plain JavaScript and jQuery), JSON, polling, push (WebSockets) and AngularJS.

In this project, the actual chat functionality is implemented using polling, while WebSockets would probably be the smarter choice.
